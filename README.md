Artificial intelligence coursework

This work deals with Multiclass Image Classification of a butterfly dataset using Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets). The dataset consists of the training set of 10270 images of butterflies which were narrowed down into 23 classes – families of butterflies. Furthermore, the model’s accuracy is tested on the test set of 15009 examples.
Using transfer learning and EfficientNet-B5 pre-trained model on ImageNet dataset, the model achieved validation accuracy of 96.56% and test accuracy of 94.81%, which placed me in top 10% of the students.
